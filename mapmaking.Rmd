## All Maps are Not Created Equally

**_Good maps make a difference!_**

While there many ways to make a map, ultimately it would seem there should only be one way to interpret a map. A map cut through confusion and clarify where things are in space (or time). If a map is effective, a reader shouldn't need too much time to observe the information the map is trying to portray. 

Maps can be very effective **and** beautiful! They do not need to be one or the other. Good visualizations often simplify to the pieces (landscapes, points of interest, temporal change) of interest, and remove any other distractions. 

### Keep Things Simple!

Maps don't need to have every single layer or detail. They need **the relevant details**, so anyone can quickly take a look at the map, orient themselves, and extract the important information.

This animation (created by Darkhorse Analytics, and used in Jenny Bryan's excellent [stat545](http://stat545.com/block015_graph-dos-donts.html) course) shows how *simplification* can make a big difference in communication. Granted, this is for figures, and not specifically for maps, but the point is the same.
