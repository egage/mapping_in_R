# Point Data with `rgdal` and `sf`

There are loads of spatial mapping/plotting packages in R. The main two ways to read in spatial data use the `rgdal` package, and the `sf` package. I'm going to show how you can load and plot XY data using either method.

**Let's load packages first:**

```{r load libs, warning=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(rgdal); # spatial/shp reading
  library(readr); # reading/writing files
  library(dplyr); # wrangling data/plotting
  library(viridis); # nice color palette
  library(sf); # newer "simple features" spatial package
  library(rvest) # scraping web data
  library(maps); # for map functions
  library(maptools) # map data
  }) 

```

## Get XY Data: CA Hotsprings

The simplest type of data to plot is X/Y points. You might have a `.csv` lying around with site locations, or even better, a shapefile. For this example, let's use this list of [CA hotsprings](http://www.hotspringsenthusiast.com/California.asp). It provides names, *Latitude & Longitude* and water temperatures in C and F for each hotspring. I've already downloaded the file so you can just read the file link directly into R as follows:

```{r getHotspring_csv, echo=T, eval=T}

df_locs<- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanpeek/mapping_in_R/master/data/hotsprings_CA.csv")

```

#### Optional: WebScraping the Table

If you're interested in more info on web scraping, definitely check out some of the DSI material from Duncan ([here](https://github.com/dsidavis/WebScrapingFall17) and [here](https://github.com/dsidavis/AdvancedScrapingInfo)). I'm going to use a method I demonstrated in a blog I wrote a few weeks ago (*[check it out here](https://ryanpeek.github.io/2017-10-24-mapping-with-sf-part-1/)*) which shows how to use a package called `rvest` to pretty quickly and easily grab data from any part of a webpage. Let's see how it works. 

  - First we need to go the webpage, and then right click and select _**Inspect**_. I'm using Chrome as my browser here. 
  - Then in the upper right hand box, hover/scroll around until the table part of the webpage is highlighted. Right click on that line and select "**Copy** > **Copy Xpath**".
  - Read in with the code below!
  
```{r getHotspringData, eval=F, echo=T}

library(rvest)

url <- "http://www.hotspringsenthusiast.com/California.asp"

df <- url %>%
  read_html() %>% 
  
  ## NOW THE XPATH WE COPIED!
  html_nodes(xpath='/html/body/table') %>% # use inspect and xpath with chrome
  html_table()

df_locs <- df[[1]] # reads in as a list, so we are just eliminating the list and making this a dataframe

# Great! Let's add colnames and clean up a bit:
dim(df_locs)

# set_names from purrr package is nice for adding col names
df_locs <- df_locs %>% set_names(nm = c("State", "Lat", "Lon", "Spring_Name", "Temp_C", "Temp_F", "Area", "USGS_Quad"))

# Make the temp data numeric
df_locs <- df_locs %>% mutate_at(.vars = c("Temp_C", "Temp_F"), .funs = as.numeric)

# save as a CSV!
# write_csv(df_locs, path = "data/hotsprings_CA.csv")

```

### Make XY "Spatial": `rgdal`

Now we have some data, let's show how to read it in as spatial data using the `rgdal` pipeline. This requires creating a `SpatialPointsDataFrame`. We'll use the extension `sp` for data of this type.

```{r makeXYspatial_rgdal, echo=T, eval=T, message=FALSE, warning=F}

# read in data
df_locs <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanpeek/mapping_in_R/master/data/hotsprings_CA.csv") # or as file:  data/hotsprings_CA.csv

# rename
df_locs <- df_locs %>% set_names(nm = c("State", "Lat", "Lon", "Spring_Name", "Temp_C", "Temp_F", "Area", "USGS_Quad"))

# Make the temp data numeric
df_locs <- df_locs %>% mutate_at(.vars = c("Temp_C", "Temp_F"), .funs = as.numeric)

head(df_locs) # wait...what's up with Lon?
```

#### A note on Lat/Longs

For data from the North American continent, keep an eye on your lat/longs. A common snafu that can occur is the longitude may remain positive, which will plot your point somewhere in the Indian Ocean. Make sure all your longitudes are negative (if in the US and using lat/longs).

Here we need to fix this column, and then make our data "*spatial*" with the `SpatialPointsDataFrame()` function. Note we also set the projection based for our data.

```{r latlongSP, echo=T, eval=T}

df_locs$Lon <- df_locs$Lon * -1

# make spatial Dataframe object: 
df_locs_sp  <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(df_locs[,c(3,2)],df_locs[,-c(3,2)]) 

# no projection:
proj4string(df_locs_sp) # NA

# set projections
utms <- CRS("+init=epsg:32610") ## more detailed def using the EPSG code
utms # more detail
lats84<-CRS("+init=epsg:4326") # set the default for lat/longs
lats84

# Project our data
proj4string(df_locs_sp)<-lats84
proj4string(df_locs_sp) # looks like it matches!

# if you want to reproject (say to UTM):
df_locs_sp_utm<-spTransform(df_locs_sp, utms)
proj4string(df_locs_sp_utm) # double check data to make sure it has CRS

```

### Make XY "Spatial": `sf`

Great, now let's see how to do the same thing using the `sf` package. Notice the amount of code we wrote above...and below.

```{r makeXYspatial_sf, echo=T, eval=T}

# make data sf object: 
df_locs_sf <- st_as_sf(df_locs, 
#                    coords = c("Lon", "Lat"), # can use numbers here too
                    coords = c(3, 2), # can use numbers here too
                    remove = F, # don't remove these lat/lon cols from df
                    crs = 4326) # add projection (this is WGS84)

```

That's it! We're done! 

Ok! So we've pulled in a list of XY locations. These could have come from field work, a GPS device, whatever. We projected this dataset into **`WGS84`** which is fairly universal (and easily plotted in things like *googlemaps, leaflet, Google Earth, etc.*). On to plotting.

## Plotting XY Data

Let's plot the data. I'll show how to do the same map using both `sf` and `rgdal`. Let's introduce `map` and `maptools` packages, which provide some nice functionality.

### Plotting with `Spatial` (`rgdal`) Data

```{r mapXY_sp}
# need to have maps and maptools loaded here
library(maps)
library(maptools)

# add States
map("state",region=c('CA')) # get a CA map
map.axes() # add axes

# add counties
map("county",region=c('CA'),boundary=FALSE, lty=3, add=T, col="gray70")

# add our hotspring point data from earlier: sp version
points(df_locs_sp, cex=0.8, pch=21, bg="skyblue")

# Cool! Let's zoom in a bit and add a legend
map("state",region=c('CA'), xlim = c(-121,-119.2), ylim=c(38,40))
map.axes()
map("county",region=c('CA'),boundary=FALSE, lty=3, add=T, col="gray70",
    xlim = c(-121,-119.2), ylim=c(38,40))
points(df_locs_sp, cex=0.8, pch=21, bg="skyblue")

# add labels (using trial and error for placement)
text(df_locs_sp, labels=as.character(df_locs_sp@data$Spring_Name), col="gray20",
     cex=0.6, font=2, offset=0.5, adj=c(0,2))

# add a plot legend
legend("topright", border = "gray80", box.lwd = 1.5, 
       box.col = "gray80",
       legend=c("Hot Springs", "Counties"),
       title="Study Map", bty="o", inset=0.05,
       lty=c(-1,3), pch=c(21, NA), cex=0.8,
       col=c("black", "gray70"), pt.bg=c("skyblue", NA))

```

### Plotting with `sf` Data

Can we do the same thing with `sf` data? Nope! Not in the same way. You'll get this error:

```
Error in data.matrix(x) : 
  (list) object cannot be coerced to type 'double'
```

Baseplotting functions work with `sf`, but be aware, using `plot` will default to plotting a facet or map for every column of data in your dataframe. Avoid that by specifying `st_coordinates()`.

```{r mapXY_sf1, eval=T, echo=T}

# the simplest plot with sf data: 
plot(df_locs_sf, pch=16, col=adjustcolor("maroon", alpha=0.7), cex=1.5) #YIKES

# this is better
plot(st_coordinates(df_locs_sf), pch=16, col=adjustcolor("maroon", alpha=0.7), cex=1.5)
graphics::title("Map of CA Hot Springs")

```

### Plotting with `ggplot` and `ggmap`

Alternatively, we can use `ggplot2` instead. This is where `sf` objects are really nice. They fit well within the ggplot framework because they are simply dataframes with a spatial list-column. You can plot XY data as a regular layer, or you can use the `geom_sf` function. 

The only caveat here is we currently (as of `r Sys.Date()`) need the development version of `ggplot2`. To install, use:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")

```

Once we have the dev version of `ggplot2`, we can make a fancier plot.

```{r mapXY_sf2, eval=T, echo=T}
# fancier ggplot w google background plot:
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap) # need this package
location=c(-119.7,38.7) # set the center of the map

# set the background map up
map1 <- get_map(location=location, crop = F,
             color="bw",
             maptype="satellite",
             source="google",
             zoom=8)

sitemap <- ggmap(map1) # start a ggmap... like calling ggplot()

# and let's make our nicemap
nicemap<-
  sitemap + 
  geom_point(data=df_locs_sf, aes(x=Lon, y=Lat, fill=Temp_F), pch=21, alpha=0.7, size=4)+
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "A")+
  labs(x="Longitude (WGS84)", y="Latitude",
       title="Hot Springs in California") + 
  theme_bw(base_family = "Roboto Condensed") # change this to sans if it doesn't plot
nicemap

# To save plot
# ggsave(filename = "./figs/site_map_ggplot.png", width = 8, height = 6, units = "in", dpi = 300)

```
