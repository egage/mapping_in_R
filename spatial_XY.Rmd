# XY Data with `rgdal` and `sf`

There are loads of spatial mapping/plotting packages in R. The main two ways to read in spatial data use the `rgdal` package, and the `sf` package. I'm going to show how you can load and plot XY data using either method.

**Let's load packages first:**

```{r load libs, warning=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(rgdal); # spatial/shp reading
  library(tidyverse); # wrangling data/plotting
  library(viridis); # nice color palette
  library(sf); # newer "simple features" spatial package
  library(rvest) # scraping web data
  library(maps); # for map functions
  library(maptools) # map data
  }) 

```

## Get XY Data: CA Hotsprings

The simplest type of data to plot is X/Y points. You might have a `.csv` lying around with site locations, or even better, a shapefile. For now let's show how to get some data and use it with the packages disussed above. Scraping data from the web requires a table of some sort, and for this example, we'll use a Chrome browser (but same idea applies for other browsers). 

Let's use this list of [CA hotsprings](http://www.hotspringsenthusiast.com/California.asp). It provides names, *Latitude & Longitude* and water temperatures in C and F for each hotspring. I'm going to use a method I demonstrated in a blog I wrote a few weeks ago (*[check it out here](https://ryanpeek.github.io/2017-10-24-mapping-with-sf-part-1/)*) which shows how to use a package called `rvest` to pretty quickly and easily grab data from any part of a webpage. Let's see how it works. 

  - First we need to go the webpage, and then right click and select _**Inspect**_. I'm using Chrome as my browser here. 
  - Then in the upper right hand box, hover/scroll around until the table part of the webpage is highlighted. Right click on that line and select "**Copy** > **Copy Xpath**".
  - Read in with the code below!
  
Once we have that in the global environment we can fix it up however we need.

```{r getHotspringData, eval=F, echo=T}

library(rvest)

url <- "http://www.hotspringsenthusiast.com/California.asp"

df <- url %>%
  read_html() %>% 
  
  ## NOW THE XPATH WE COPIED!
  html_nodes(xpath='/html/body/table') %>% # use inspect and xpath with chrome
  html_table()

df_locs <- df[[1]] # reads in as a list, so we are just eliminating the list and making this a dataframe

# Great! Let's add colnames and clean up a bit:
dim(df_locs)

# set_names from purrr package is nice for adding col names
df_locs <- df_locs %>% set_names(nm = c("State", "Lat", "Lon", "Spring_Name", "Temp_C", "Temp_F", "Area", "USGS_Quad"))

# Make the temp data numeric
df_locs <- df_locs %>% mutate_at(.vars = c("Temp_C", "Temp_F"), .funs = as.numeric)

# save as a CSV!
write.csv(df_locs, file = "data/hotsprings_CA.csv", row.names = F)
```

### Make XY "Spatial": `rgdal`

Now we have some data, let's show how to read it in as spatial data using the `rgdal` pipeline. This requires creating a `SpatialPointsDataFrame`. We'll use the extension `sp` for data of this type.

```{r makeXYspatial_rgdal, echo=T, eval=T}

# read in data
df_locs <- read.csv("data/hotsprings_CA.csv") 

head(df_locs) # wait...what's up with Lon?

df_locs$Lon <- df_locs$Lon * -1

# make CDEC data sf object (spatial): 
df_locs_sp  <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(df_locs[,c(3,2)],df_locs[,-c(3,2)]) 

# no projection:
proj4string(df_locs_sp) # NA

# set projections
utms <- CRS("+init=epsg:32610") ## more detailed def using the EPSG code
utms # more detail
lats84<-CRS("+init=epsg:4326") # set the default for lat/longs
lats84

# Project our data
proj4string(df_locs_sp)<-lats84
proj4string(df_locs_sp) # looks like it matches!

# if you want to reproject (say to UTM):
df_locs_sp_utm<-spTransform(df_locs_sp, utms)
proj4string(df_locs_sp_utm) # double check data to make sure it has CRS

```

### Make XY "Spatial": `sf`

Here's how to do the same thing using the `sf` package.

```{r makeXYspatial_sf, echo=T, eval=T}

# read in data
df_locs <- read.csv("data/hotsprings_CA.csv") %>% 
  mutate(Lon= Lon * -1)

# make data sf object: 
df_locs_sf <- st_as_sf(df_locs, 
#                    coords = c("Lon", "Lat"), # can use numbers here too
                    coords = c(3, 2), # can use numbers here too
                    remove = F, # don't remove these lat/lon cols from df
                    crs = 4326) # add projection (this is WGS84)

```


Ok! So we've pulled in a list of XY locations. These could have come from field work, a GPS device, whatever. We projected this dataset into **`WGS84`** which is fairly universal (and easily plotted in things like *googlemaps, leaflet, Google Earth, etc.*).

## Plotting XY Data

Let's plot the data. I'll show how to do the same map using both `sf` and `rgdal`. Let's introduce `map` and `maptools` packages, which provide some nice functionality.

### Plotting with `Spatial` (`rgdal`) Data

```{r mapXY_sp}
# need to have maps and maptools loaded here

# add States
map("state",region=c('CA'))
map.axes()
# add counties
map("county",region=c('CA'),boundary=FALSE, lty=3, add=T, col="gray70")
# add our hotspring point data from earlier: sp version
points(df_locs_sp, cex=0.8, pch=21, bg="skyblue")

# Cool! Let's zoom in a bit and add a legend
map("state",region=c('CA'), xlim = c(-121,-119.2), ylim=c(38,40))
map.axes()
map("county",region=c('CA'),boundary=FALSE, lty=3, add=T, col="gray70",
    xlim = c(-121,-119.2), ylim=c(38,40))
points(df_locs_sp, cex=0.8, pch=21, bg="skyblue")

# add labels (using trial and error for placement)
text(df_locs_sp, labels=as.character(df_locs_sp@data$Spring_Name), col="gray20",
     cex=0.6, font=2, offset=0.5, adj=c(0,2))

# add a plot legend
legend("topright", border = "gray80", box.lwd = 1.5, 
       box.col = "gray80",
       legend=c("Hot Springs", "Counties"),
       title="Study Map", bty="o", inset=0.05,
       lty=c(-1,3), pch=c(21, NA), cex=0.8,
       col=c("black", "gray70"), pt.bg=c("skyblue", NA))

```

### Plotting with `sf` Data

Can we do the same thing with `sf` data? Nope! You'll get this error:

```
Error in data.matrix(x) : 
  (list) object cannot be coerced to type 'double'
```
Baseplotting functions work with `sf`, but be aware it will plot a facet or map for column of data in your dataframe. Avoid that by specifying `st_coordinates()`.

```{r mapXY_sf1, eval=T, echo=T}

# the simplest plot with sf data: 
plot(df_locs_sf, pch=16, col=adjustcolor("maroon", alpha=0.7), cex=1.5) #YIKES

# this is better
plot(st_coordinates(df_locs_sf), pch=16, col=adjustcolor("maroon", alpha=0.7), cex=1.5)
graphics::title("Map of CA Hot Springs",
      family="Roboto Condensed")

```

### Plotting with `ggplot` and `ggmap`

Alternatively, we can use `ggplot2` instead. This is where `sf` objects are really nice. They fit well within the ggplot framework because they are simply dataframes with a spatial list-column. You can plot XY data as a regular layer, or you can use the `geom_sf` function. 

```{r mapXY_sf2, eval=T, echo=T}
# fancier ggplot w google background plot:

library(ggmap) # need this package
location=c(-119.7,38.7) # set the center of the map

# set the background map up
map1 <- get_map(location=location,crop = F,
             color="bw",
             maptype="terrain",
             source="google",
             zoom=8)

sitemap <- ggmap(map1) # start a ggmap... like calling ggplot()

# and let's make our nicemap
nicemap<-
  sitemap + 
  geom_point(data=df_locs_sf, aes(x=Lon, y=Lat, fill=Temp_F), pch=21, alpha=0.7, size=4)+
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "A")+
  labs(x="Longitude (WGS84)", y="Latitude",
       title="Hot Springs in California") + 
  theme_bw(base_family = "Roboto Condensed")
nicemap

# To save plot
# ggsave(filename = "./figs/site_map_ggplot.png", width = 8, height = 6, units = "in", dpi = 300)

```
